Most wait for permission to lead.

I've watched countless nurses transform healthcare without fancy titles or executive approval.

The real innovators join committees where decisions happen. They pilot solutions to problems others just complain about. They document results that build influence.

These nurses don't just use new technology. They shape how it works.

A nurse on my team noticed patient falls increasing during shift changes. She gathered data, proposed a simple communication protocol, and reduced falls by 23%.

No one asked her to solve this problem.

She saw an opportunity and took action.
